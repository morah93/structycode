// add lists
// Write a function, addLists, that takes in the head of two linked lists, each representing a number.
// The nodes of the linked lists contain digits as values.The nodes in the input lists are reversed; this means that the least significant digit of the number is the head.
// The function should return the head of a new linked listed representing the sum of the input lists.The output list should have its digits reversed as well.

// You must do this by traversing through the linked lists once.


const addLists = (head1, head2) => {
  // todo
};
